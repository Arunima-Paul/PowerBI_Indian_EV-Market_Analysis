# PowerBI_Indian_EV-Market_Analysis
This is a study of the Indian electric vehicle market.
**1. **Problem Statement****
AtliQ Motors is a major automotive player from the USA specializing in electric vehicles.
While they have captured 25% of the EV market in North America, their presence in India is still small—less than 2% market share.
Their chief in India wanted a detailed market study before expanding their bestselling models here, and that's exactly what I have done.

Note that the fiscal year in India starts from April and ends in March of the following year, which is reflected in our analysis. 
In this dataset data of FY 2022,2023,2024 are analysed.
Data is recorded on a monthly basis. Fiscal quarters are typically divided as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

**2. The Big Picture: Indian EV Market**
Let's start with the overall market performance. Our data shows that India has seen 1.02 million EV sales, with about 191,300 2-wheelers and 153,000 4-wheelers. 
The overall EV penetration rate stands at 3.61%, with the total vehicle market growing at a healthy CAGR of 13.56%. For EV market CAGR is 93.91%
Now, what does this mean? It means India's EV market, while still developing, is showing promising growth trajectories that AtliQ Motors can tap into.

**3. Who's Winning the EV Race?**
Let's look at who's dominating the market right now.
In the two-wheeler category, OLA ELECTRIC is the clear leader with nearly 490,000 units sold from 2022-2024. 
They've shown remarkable growth, jumping from just 14,401 units in 2022 to over 322,489 units in 2024. Following OLA are TVS with 272,575 units and ATHER with 204,449 units.
For the four-wheeler category, which is our primary focus, TATA Motors leads with 88935 units sold over the three-year period. They grew from 12,708 units in 2022 to 48,181 in 2024. 
Mahindra & Mahindra follows with 41,193 units, and MG Motor takes third place with 1,753 units.
But here's where it gets interesting—when we look at growth rates instead of just sale volume.

**4. Understanding CAGR: Our Growth Metric**
Before that I share the growth analysis, let me quickly explain what CAGR or Compound Annual Growth Rate means, as it is important to understand market momentum.
CAGR tells us how much something has grown each year over a period of time on average, assuming the growth happened smoothly year after year—even if, in reality, it went up and down.
For example-Imagine you invest ₹1,000 in a business. After 3 years, your investment becomes ₹1,331.
You want to know: "How much did it grow each year?"
CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1 / Number of Years)] – 1
CAGR = [(1331 / 1000) ^ (1 / 3)] - 1
= (1.331 ^ 0.3333) - 1
= 1.10 - 1
= 0.10 or 10%
The CAGR would be 10% per year. So, even if some years were better or worse than others, the average yearly growth was 10% per year.

**Why is CAGR so useful in our EV analysis? 
It helps us to**
1.	Identify real growth leaders, even if their absolute sales are small-
2.	Compare makers fairly by removing year-to-year fluctuations
3.	Spot future market disruptors. Small players with high CAGR may become major players if the trend continues.
4.  Balance size versus momentum- Total sales show market share; CAGR shows momentum — you need both to understand competitive positioning.
Now, with that understanding, let's look at the CAGR for EV manufacturers.

**5. Growth Champions: The Surprising Players**
When we analyze the CAGR of four-wheeler manufacturers from 2022-2024, we see a very different picture than just looking at total sales:
BMW India shows exceptional growth with an astounding 1,140% CAGR, followed by Volvo Auto India at 971%. BYD India, Hyundai Motor
and Mercedes-Benz have also shown strong growth rates of 564%, 255%, and 224% respectively.
Interestingly, TATA Motors, despite being the volume leader, has the lowest CAGR among top makers at around 95%.
What does this tell us? The premium segment is growing faster than the mass market, 
which presents an opportunity for AtliQ Motors to position themselves strategically.

Let's see what is in the 2 Wheeler category- CAGR from 2022-2024:
•	OLA ELECTRIC leads with 373.22% CAGR
•	TVS (330.80%) and BAJAJ (285.65%) show strong growth
•	ATHER (132.04%) and OTHERS (77.89%) have more moderate growth rates
**•	It aligns similarly with the sales volume.**


**6. Seasonal Patterns**
Looking at monthly sales patterns, we see peak EV sales in March, with another spike in October and November. 
Sales typically dip in July-August and January.
The quarterly chart shows consistent growth from Q1 2022 through Q4 2024, with Q4 2024 reaching 320,000 units—the highest in the period.
